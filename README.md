## Hi there 👋
My name is Strasse, a Python developer based in The Netherlands.

I like working on Python-related projects, and I’m mostly focused on Discord.py. I build my own stuff and enjoy being challenged with difficult coding problems.

Coding became my hobby, and I love troubleshooting errors and solving issues. I also like creating unique Discord.py ideas that I will definitely post on GitHub.

Coding is not my job, and I don’t want it to be my job for now. I just enjoy it as a hobby.

### Tools
- Python
- Discord.py

### About me
- I’m 18 years old and started developing when I was 13.
- Definitely not a morning person, but I love coffee.
- I like building advanced, yet simple to understand projects for the world.
